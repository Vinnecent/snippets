// Different JavaScript comment styles

// Each line starting with "//" is a comment

var theComment = 1; // A comment can start somewhere in the middle of a line

/*
Comments can span multiple lines as long as they start and end with a slash / asterisk pair

And they can be as long as you want
*/


/* Multiple line comments can contain single line comments

// A single line comment

*/

// Multiple line comments can also be used to comment out something in the middle of a line

var /* Comment */ thePenguin = "was here";

// But whether it's smart to use this, is another matter.
